== 'Decommissioning' old documents

As a matter of practice, the Secretariat will 'decommission' and remove earlier versions of documents from GBIF through the following series of steps:

. Register a GBIF DOI via DataCite for the previous version of the document (provided that one does not already exist)
. Produce an archival standard version (PDF/A) of the documentâ€”or documents, if translations are available
. Deposit the file(s) in Zenodo with the assigned DOI
. Update the DataCite metadata to resolve the DOI to the new Zenodo deposit
. Include a reference to the earlier version in the current document's metadata on GBIF.org (e.g. https://www.gbif.org/document/80925)

This approach achieves several key goals:

* Previous versions will be permanently discoverable using a persistent identifier
* GBIF will no longer have to manage either the old file or its URL (or, as is more often the case, URLs, plural) 
* Users searching on GBIF.org will retrieve only the current documents, which then reference older versions
