Guidelines for authoring GBIF documentation.

*Placeholder text, this document is not yet written!*

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories are stored in GitHub, and the source code files can be edited within the Github interface, or on a computer (including when offline) using Git.  Many tutorials for using both Git and Github are available on the web.

Files in the repository with the file extension `.adoc` are the source code for the document.  The file `index.adoc` is the index page, it must contain (usually with the `include` command) all parts of the document.

Asciidoctor
~~~~~~~~~~~

The document is built using _Asciidoctor_, a document format which uses plain text formatting to describe the document's structure, and allow a style to be applied automatically.  For information on the syntax, see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual].

Generating the document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code in the document repositories is converted into the finished HTML and PDF documents using the _Asciidoctor_ tool.  Every time a change is made to a repository, the GBIF build server is notified.  It retrieves the source code, generates the documents, and copies the formatted documents to a webserver.

A log file of recent builds is kept by the build server.  If there is a syntax error preventing the document from being generated, you will need to inspect the log file to see what the problem is.

Local document build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are familiar with software development tools, you can build a document on your own computer – this is useful for previewing changes.  You can build the HTML document with this command, run from the top level directory:

`+docker run -it -v $PWD:/documents/ asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor asciidoctor index.adoc+`

To create the PDF document, use `asciidoctor-pdf` rather than `asciidoctor`.  The result is called either `index.html` or `index.pdf`.
