== Background

GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—has long produced technical documentation on a range of topics relating to biodiversity informatics and open biodiversity data with the aim of supporting a global community of practice. 

The GBIF Secretariat is now coordinating the development of such documentation while engaging its community to work with subject-matter experts commissioned to create and update under the guidance of an [editorial panel]. This goal of this approach is to provide uniform, reliable, reusable and versioned materials that can be easily updated while instilling community trust in the documentation and fostering its use.
