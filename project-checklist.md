= Project checklist

This checklist provides documentation authors, staff of the GBIF Secretariat and editorial panel members with a punch list for actions needed to initiate a new project, to share it for public review and to close out the active phase of preparing a 'full' version of any given documentation.

=== Starting a new documentation project

- [ ] Clone doc-template repository and give the new repository a short name, including the prefix 'doc-', that reflects the title of the new documentation project e.g. https://github.com/gbif/doc-effective-nodes-guidance[doc-effective-nodes-guidance] for the document _Establishing an Effective GBIF Participant Node Concepts and general considerations_ 
- [ ] Set up a new Jenkins project
- [ ] Register a new DOI for the documentation through GBIF's DataCite account, starting with the prefix 'doc-', e.g. https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-z79c-sa53
- [ ] Write, adding documents to the repository as structure dictates

=== Distributing documentation for public review

- [ ] Prepare draft document in AsciiDoc format on repository
- [ ] Make registered DOI 'findable' via DataCite   
- [ ] Announce dates for public review via GBIF email lists, community forum and social media as appropriate

=== Close out a version of the documentation
