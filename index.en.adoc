GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—has long produced technical documentation on a range of topics relating to biodiversity informatics and open biodiversity data with the aim of supporting a global community of practice. 

The GBIF Secretariat is now seeking to clarify its coordination role in developing such documentation while engaging its community to collaborate with subject-matter experts commissioned to create and update under the guidance of an editorial panel. This goal of this approach is to provide uniform, reliable, reusable, versioned, and easily updatable materials that instill community trust in the available documentation and foster its use. 

The key features of this system will include

* Standardized documentation
* Routine updates, versioning and translations
* Community input 
* Peer review
* Searchable format

== The Editorial Panel

The Editorial Panel (EP) consists of a volunteer group of experts that, in coordination with GBIF Secretariat staff, will provide oversight, guidance and peer-review of the GBIF documentation. The EP will provide recommendations to the GBIF Secretariat on commissioning high-priority guidance from subject-matter experts, with the following responsibilities:

.Prioritize needs both for updating/revising existing documentation and for generating new documentation.
.Establish review process (how reviews will happen, how many members are required for review, timeline, etc.).
.Make recommendations regarding the documentation system (via GitHub repositories) for future sustainability.
.Review drafts and provide comments back to authors.

== Operations

Each year, the EP will review available documentation and identify priority candidates for updates. and will review and approve updated documentation for publication. The EP should consult widely with other experts, institutions, initiatives andprojects within the biodiversity informatics community at-large when considering updates to and for new documentation.

=== Annual process

.Annually, the EP shall prioritize documentation needs and make recommendations for calls for documentation when appropriate.
.Calls will issued by GBIFS to the community when appropriate.
.EP will review and make recommendations on documentation proposals.
.GBIFS will draw and issue contract with authors/teams of experts.
.Authors will compile first draft drawing on community input when appropriate and submit to EP.
.EP will review drafts and provide comments back to authors.
.Authors will revise drafts based on EP’s review.
.Versions will be released publicly and openly.
.GBIFS will complete and issue derived products (translations, training modules, etc.).

== Guidelines for document authors

Unlike a word processor like _Microsoft Word_, GBIF's documentation is stored in plain text files.  This means

* Authors need not worry about maintaining a consistent style,
* Changes to the document can be tracked and managed using general tools,
* The same source files can produce multiple outputs automatically, such as HTML and PDF,
* Document translations can be tracked.

Of course, that does mean learning about some different tools — but the ones we have chosen are widely used in publishing, software development and translation communities.

=== "Source code"

The plain text files and other assets (images, data tables) that form each document comprises the _source code_.

These source files are stored in a _Git repository_, which (for GBIF) is managed by a commercial service, _GitHub_.

The source code for this document is stored at https://github.com/gbif/doc-documentation-guidelines/, the source code for this part of the document can be seen https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbif/doc-documentation-guidelines/master/index.adoc[here].

Contributors can edit the source code either in a web browser using the GitHub interface or on a computer (including when offline) using Git. They may also submit https://github.com/gbif/doc-documentation-guidelines/issues[issues] that comment or flag problems for others to address, including outdated information, broken links, misspellings and the like.

NOTE: Many tutorials for using both Git and Github are available on the web.

=== AsciiDoctor

GBIF documentation is maintained and published using a fast text processor and publishing toolchain called _AsciiDoctor_. Content for this system uses AsciiDoc, a lightweight _markup language_ whose format and structure (such as headings and bold text) are applied using particular symbols and conventions visible in the text. AsciiDoctor then converts this AsciiDoc syntax into the required formatting depending on the output format.

For example, the source code for the heading and first line of this section looks like this:

```
=== AsciiDoctor

GBIF documentation is maintained and published using a fast text processor and publishing toolchain called _AsciiDoctor_.
```

The `pass:[===]` prefix indicates a third-level heading, and the underscore symbols surrounding `+_AsciiDoc_+` specify emphasized text. Decisions regarding elements like the font or text size are not included in the main document.

The document (or parts of it) is stored in files with the extension `.en.adoc`, where `.en.` indicates the language using the ISO two-letter language codes. Other source files such as images have their usual extensions.

The main document that compiles any given document is called `index.en.adoc`.

NOTE: For information on the syntax of AsciiDoctor, see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual].

=== Generating the document

The source code in the repository is converted into the finished HTML and PDF documents using the _Asciidoctor_ tool.  Every time a change is made to the repository, the GBIF build server is notified.  It retrieves the source code, generates the document, and copies the formatted documents to a webserver.

A log file of recent builds is kept by the build server.  If there is a syntax error preventing the document from being generated, you may need to inspect the log file to see what the problem is.

=== Local document build

WARNING: This section isn't yet final, as the tools are still being developed.

If you are familiar with software development tools, and using GBIF's office network or VPN, you can build a document on your own computer – this is useful for previewing changes.  You can build the HTML document with this command, run from the top level directory:

`+docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/documents/ mb.gbif.org:5000/gbif-asciidoctor-toolkit+`

To create the PDF document, use `asciidoctor-pdf` rather than `asciidoctor`.  The result is called either `index.en.html` or `index.en.pdf`.

=== Further guidelines

_We should perhaps include in this document:_

* Handling issues in GitHub,
* Handling pull requests,
* Who to ask for help.

== Guidelines for document translators

The translation uses `.po` "_Portable Object_" files, which are commonly used for translating software and websites.  To translate a document into a new language, or update an existing translation, you will need to:

. For a new language, copy the `index.pot` (_Portable Object Template_) file to the new file `xx.po`, where `xx` is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes[language code], for example this would be `da.po` for a Danish translation.
. To update a translation, open the `xx.po` file in a po-file editor and choose the option to "Update from POT file" or similar.
. Use a po-file editor to make the translations.  Examples are https://poedit.net/[Poedit] (software) or https://localise.biz/free/poeditor[poeditor] (website).
. Use Git/GitHub to replace the old translation file with your updated translation file.

== Guidelines for software developers

NOTE: This section is technical information for GBIF software developers maintaining the system that powers these documents.

The documents combine several small Linux tools:

* Git, for source control,
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], chosen with essentially the same reasoning as https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc/blob/5.1.0/doc_alternatives/README.adoc[the KiCad documentation authors] (and following their approach to translation),
* https://po4a.org/[po4a], for translations,
* https://builds.gbif.org/[GBIF's Jenkins server], for document compilation,
* Docker, to ensure consistent builds,
* Apache, to serve the finished documents.

The result is mostly contained in a https://github.com/gbif/gbif-asciidoctor-toolkit[Docker container], with some integration in the Jenkins build job.

=== New documents

New documents should be made by:

. Cloning the https://github.com/gbif/doc-template[doc-template] repository, with a name beginning with `doc-`,
. Adding a new job to Jenkins.

=== Outstanding issues:

. Apply a custom style to the document,
. Demonstrate embedding an image, and alternative (translated) images,
. Determine where the exported documents will be stored,
. Decide a release process, possibly involving assigning DOIs.
